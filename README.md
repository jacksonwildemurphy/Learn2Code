# Learn2Code
An educational desktop app game for learning the basics of programming. Use conditionals, loops, and more to help Codey the robot pass all 9 levels! The stunning graphics and realistic Box2D physics engine will be sure to have your students addicted.

Teachers and students can create user accounts, and teachers can track their students' progress online thanks to the app's back-end RESTful server, MySQL database, and the use of Javascript D3 visual charts.
